# Spec draft

- Gaps continuing to be filled in
- Much better alignment with polyfill
- https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/

---

# Polyfill

- Get a Node environment with the Temporal polyfill:
  - `git clone https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal`
  - `cd proposal-temporal/polyfill`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run playground`
- Test262 test suite being built up
- Few things missing:
  - custom calendars
  - custom time zones
  - `Temporal.parse()`?
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/tree/main/polyfill

---

# Cookbook

- Examples of "How do I do ... with Temporal?"
- Most commonly asked questions on Stack Overflow for legacy `Date`
- Use cases gathered from conversations
- https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html

<!--
So one of the things brought up last time was (Leo) a request for better examples of the API in general, and showing some use-cases.

So we have worked on a cookbook.
These are some of the most common tasks that people ask questions about on StackOverflow with legacy Date. Here's how they would look using Temporal.

Some examples are:
* Getting the unix timestamp
* Getting the current date and time
* How can i sort or compare dates with each other.
* Given a month and year, how do I get the first tuesday of the month?
